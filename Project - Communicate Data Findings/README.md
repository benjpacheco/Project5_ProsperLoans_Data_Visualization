# Prosper Loans Data Exploration
## by Ben Pacheco


## Dataset

> The data consists of information regarding 113,937 loans, including loan amounts, interest rates, APR, loan status, borrower monthly income, and other important factors.


## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration, I found that there was a moderate relationship between loan amounts and the rates (BorrowerRate/BorrwerAPR) with several different Credit Grades/Prosper Ratings given to Prosper customers. For customers that have no credit we see an upward slope with the loan amounts increasing and APR. Grades E and D seem to have a negative slope which aligns with bivariate findings, while anything higher than those two we can see the slope getting less steep  in a positive trend therefore higher grade assigned to the loan means the loan amount and rates will go up. This was an interesting finding because plotting loan amounts and the rates gives us a negative trend line. The relationship between loan amounts and interest/APR wasn't exactly linear but it showed an obvious negative correlation trend since in general the lower loan amount thats given by Prosper is tied to a higher % rate which makes total sense for a credit issuing company. I was disappointed with the correlation factors of my predictors variables in choosing, I could of selected better predictor variables to compare with loan amounts. I figured monthly income would be a good indicator of wether someone would recieve a higher amount loan. 

Other than the main variable loan amounts I verified the relationship between the % rates.
The rates had a 1:1 relationship which was not surprising, they were directly related to each other as most findings showed that if APR rose the interest would rise in relation to that APR. 


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I will focus on the distributions of the main variable along with the percentage rates (BorrowerRate/BorrowerAPR).

Afterwards, I will introduce the categorical variables compared to the main variables.
